**The Small Scalable Disassembler Engine**


If, while using the SSDE, you encounter an error, before you write a report you
are advised to make sure you're using the latest stable version of SSDE. Also
make sure it is not your code that is buggy.


@ https://github.com/notnanocat/ssde/issues create an issue explaining the bug.

It's recommended that you provide as much information on the bug as possible,
that vastly increases your changes of getting the bug fixed. In your bug report
tell us which module has the bug, under which conditions it happens, etc. We'd
really appreciate if you provide us an example code which can be used to
reproduce the bug. If you have fixed the bug by yourself, do a pull request.
Though, you are still required to provide explaination on the bug the way it's
described above.
